<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>From former college baseball player to strength coach and developer.</p>

<p>Born and raised in South Carolina, traveling for tournaments and conferences gave me the opportunity to visit a variety of states, countries, and cultures. My family likes to say that I serve as a bridge, whereas my greatgrandfather designed and engineered them. While he connected physical locations, I've always enjoyed the connections of people through relationships. From playing baseball internationally at 15 years old, to traveling internationally with my wife. All of it can be highlighted by the company I traveled with and those that I met and influenced me along the way. It sounds cheesy, but that's what has value for me, relationships. People wanting to coexist, to share, serve, and support one another. </p>

<p>As a weightlifting coach, an acupuncturist, and an analyst, my diverse skillset finds me typing this to you sitting at my kitchen table as I work through the progressions of the skills I first encountered early in my high school career in Columbia, SC and have found my way back to after 17 years... Hard to believe I have that much life experience under my belt, much less be able to say that my first practice in programming and web development took place in a much different environment than I find myself learning it today, not just the physical environment, but the life circumstances that have brought me here. </p>

<p>I look forward to connecting with you. Sharing stories and insights, and learning how these tools will further foster the building of new bridges. </p>
