<h2>Motivating Trio</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Captain America: The First Avenger</h3>
<p>Captain America established himself, not as superhuman, but super-stubborn. His commitment to the core values of to serve and protect and not backing down to a bully places Steve Rogers in a unique position to be the star spangled man with a plan. It's not about betting on the little guy, but betting on the biggest heart.</p>
<h3>Avengers: Age of Ultron</h3>
<p>James Spader with one of my favorite trailer lines "...there are no strings on me..." brings about an incredibe antagonist in the form of Ultron, a creation of Tony Stark's that takes a misguided, "updated," version of justice and safety for mankind that almost brings about it's extinction. The character development and challenge for the Avengers to come together to succeed brings a mission to protect a community, and the world.</p>
<h3>Avengers: Endgame</h3>
<p>The finality of this film for Phase 3 of MCU, the stage, the action, the effects, it all comes together in this showdown where there's only 1 in over 14 million chance.</p>
